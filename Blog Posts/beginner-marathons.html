            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Starting your first marathon journey is an exhilarating and life-changing experience. 
                As a beginner, selecting the right marathon can significantly impact your overall enjoyment 
                and achievements in the race.<br><br>
                With an abundance of marathons to choose from, the process of selecting one can be both exciting 
                and overwhelming. It's easy to get caught up in exploring the options, reading about each race's 
                unique offerings. However, the sheer number of choices can lead to decision paralysis, causing us 
                to procrastinate and never actually commit to a marathon.<br><br>
                I've personally experienced this dilemma 
                countless times, finding myself opening numerous tabs on my computer with different marathon 
                websites, leaving them open for days, only to eventually close them all without making a decision. 
                To help alleviate this challenge, I've compiled a curated list of popular marathons that are 
                particularly well-suited for first-time participants.</p>
            <h2>What you need to consider in your decision making</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Timing and Weather:</strong> Evaluate the date and time of the marathon. Research the 
                    weather conditions during that period, both at the marathon location and in your hometown. 
                    Understand how the climate may affect your training leading up to the event. For instance, if you 
                    opt for a spring marathon, prepare for potentially challenging winter training conditions. Likewise, 
                    for a fall marathon, consider the heat you might encounter during summer training.</p></li>
                <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Course Characteristics:</strong> Analyze the marathon route to determine its terrain and 
                    surface. Find out if it is predominantly on paved roads or if it incorporates other surfaces like trails. 
                    Ascertain whether the course is mostly flat or if it presents significant elevation changes and 
                    challenging hills. Choosing a course that aligns with your preferences and strengths can enhance your 
                    overall race experience.</p></li>
                <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Location and Travel:</strong> Consider the location of the marathon and assess how far you 
                    are willing to travel. Factor in the climate of the marathon destination compared to your hometown. 
                    Determine if you need to adapt to a different climate and allow extra time for acclimatization. 
                    Additionally, evaluate the logistical aspects of traveling to the marathon, such as transportation, 
                    accommodation, and associated costs.</p></li>
                <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Personal Goals and Preferences:</strong> Reflect on your personal goals for the marathon. 
                    Are you seeking a fast and flat course to target a personal record, or do you prefer a more scenic and 
                    challenging route? Consider your preferences for race atmosphere, crowd support, and potential 
                    participation in a larger or smaller event. Aligning these factors with your aspirations can contribute 
                    to a more fulfilling marathon experience.</p></li>
                <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Reputation and Reviews:</strong> Research the marathon's reputation and read reviews from 
                    previous participants. Look for feedback on the event organization, course markings, aid stations, crowd 
                    support, and overall runner experience. Learning from others' experiences can provide valuable insights 
                    to help inform your decision.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How long does it take to train for a marathon?</h2>
            <p>While the specific duration can vary depending on individual factors and training plans, there are some 
                general guidelines to consider.<br><br>
                The recommended timeframe for marathon training is typically around <strong>16 to 20 weeks</strong>. This duration allows runners 
                to gradually build their endurance, improve their fitness level, and prepare their bodies for the demanding 
                26.2-mile race.<br> 
                However, it's important to note that the duration can be adjusted based on an individual's current fitness 
                level and running experience.<br><br>
                <strong>For beginners</strong> who have little to no previous running experience, it is advisable to allow for a longer training 
                period to establish a solid foundation of running fitness and gradually increase mileage without risking injury 
                or overexertion. A training plan of <strong>at least 24 weeks</strong> would be more suitable for beginners to comfortably progress 
                and adapt to the demands of marathon training.<br><br>
                On the other hand, experienced runners who have a solid running base and prior long-distance race experience may 
                be able to follow a shorter training schedule, ranging from 12 to 16 weeks.<br><br>
                It's important to remember that marathon training is not just about logging miles. <strong>A training program should include 
                a combination of long runs, speed workouts, tempo runs, cross-training, strength training, and rest days.</strong> These 
                elements help prevent injury, improve performance, and enhance overall fitness.<br><br>
                Keep in mind that every individual is unique, and training requirements may vary. Factors such as age, fitness 
                level, previous injuries, and personal goals should be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate 
                duration of marathon training. Consulting with a running coach or experienced marathoner can provide valuable 
                insights and guidance tailored to your specific needs.<br><br>
            
                Next, we'll explore some of the best marathons specifically tailored for beginners and first-time 
                marathon runners and you don't need to qualify for any of these, you can sign up without any prior experience. 
                Whether you're seeking a scenic route, a supportive atmosphere, or a well-organized event, these marathons 
                offer the perfect opportunity to kickstart your marathon journey on the right foot.

                    and picturesque lakeside course.<br> 
                    With excellent organization and strong community support, it provides a welcoming environment for first-time marathoners. This popular race, often 
                    attracting 30 percent of first-time participants, is hailed as the "most beautiful urban marathon in America."<br> 
                    The fall setting adds to the charm, with towering trees and colorful leaves as your backdrop.<br> 
                    Enjoy stretches along the Mississippi River, tree-lined streets, and the cheers of 300,000 spectators. Plus, this year, there's a new treat at 
                    the finish line: beer!
