                <p class="intro-p">Training for a marathon requires dedication, perseverance, and a strong commitment to your goals. Staying motivated throughout the training process can be challenging; when I run into periods where it feels like a chore to get out running, I procrastinate and think of many reasons to not go. But there are several strategies you can use to keep yourself on track:</p><br><br>

        <h2>?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Set Clear Goals:</strong> Define your goals for the marathon and break them down into smaller milestones.<br> 
                Having specific objectives can give you a sense of purpose and progression as you work towards the marathon.<br> 
                E.g., complete a 10K (6.2 miles) race, achieve a half marathon distance (13.1 miles), run a 5K (3.1 miles) under a specific time, complete a long run at your marathon goal pace, run a certain number of miles per week consistently for a month, etc.<br><br>
                Remember that the milestones you set should align with your current fitness level and the time you have available for training. They should be challenging yet achievable, helping you progress steadily toward your ultimate goal of completing the marathon. Celebrate each milestone you reach, as they all contribute to your overall success.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Create a Training Plan:</strong> A structured training plan outlining your workouts, rest days, and long runs can provide a sense of direction and help you stay organized. It goes from "Do I feel like running today or tomorrow?" to "My schedule says I must run today," so it also minimizes the thought process of "Should I go running today?".</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Variety in Workouts:</strong> Incorporate a mix of workouts to keep things interesting. Include interval training, long runs, fartlek, cross-training, and strength training to prevent boredom and engage different muscle groups."</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Accountability:</strong> Share the goals you set for yourself with friends, family, or a running group. When others know about your goals, you'll feel more accountable to stick with your training plan.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Use a training journal, running app, or wearable fitness tracker to record your workouts and track your progress. Seeing improvements over time can boost your motivation.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Get Inspiration from Others:</strong> Watch YouTube videos, listen to podcasts or read books about runners, races, running gear, and anything that has to do with running.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Visualize Success:</strong> Imagine the moment when you cross the finish line, receive your medal, and achieve your marathon goal. Visualization can help reinforce your commitment and keep your motivation strong.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Reward Yourself:</strong> Treat yourself to small rewards after achieving milestones in your training. These rewards can serve as positive reinforcement for your hard work.<br> 
                E.g., new running gear, massage or spa day, favorite snack or meal, spend a day focused on relaxation, social celebration: Plan a small get-together with friends or family to celebrate your achievements together, coffee or Tea Treat: Enjoy a cup of your favorite coffee or tea at a caf√© or as part of your post-run routine, charitable Donation: Make a small donation to a cause you care about as a way to give back and celebrate your progress.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Join a Running Group:</strong> Running with others who share your goals can provide camaraderie and make training more enjoyable. It can also create a sense of community and accountability. Besides, talking to other people while running can distract you from your fatigue.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Mix Up Your Routes:</strong>Exploring new running routes can keep your runs exciting and help you discover new places.</p></li>
            <li><p class="list-p"><strong>Listen to Music or Podcasts:</strong>Create a motivating playlist or listen to inspiring podcasts during your runs to keep your mind engaged and distracted from any fatigue.<br> 
                For me, it varies a lot what I feel like listening to from day to day. On my long runs, I often listen to podcasts or audible books. When I'm tired, I listen to relaxing music while running and when I have high energy or do speed work, I like high energy music.<br> 
                Find out what suits you, variety can help keep you motivated.<br>
                Some people prefer not to listen to anything while running. This can keep you more focused on your run and more present in the moment. You can hear your own breathing pattern, your steps and your surroundings. It's all about what works for you at any given moment.</p></li>
