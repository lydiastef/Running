<h2>Top Running Races in Iceland</h2>

<h2>Hengill Ultra - June</h2> <p>The Hengill Ultra offers five distances: 10km, 26km, 53km, 106 km, and 160km, 
    taking place in the breathtaking Hengill volcano area. Starting and ending in Hveragerði, a village known for 
    its hot springs, this race involves running through valleys, mountains, and hot springs. The 160km race is the 
    longest ultra marathon in Iceland, providing a significant challenge and scenic beauty.<br>
    I have run the 26 km and 53 km courses. Amazing landscape but the time I did the 53 km the weather was horrible 
    so I couldn't see anything and dnf'ed (did not finish) at km 33. It was supposed to be my first ultra but after 
    running around in the stormy, cold, rainy and foggy surroundings somewhere in the mountains, I gave up. That's 
    the very worst weather I have ever run in and an experience I will never forget. I have heard that the scenery 
    is stunning though when it's not too foggy.<br>

    <h2>Reykjavik Marathon - August</h2>
    <p>The Reykjavik Marathon, held annually in August, is one of the most popular running events in Iceland. 
        The race features a full marathon, half marathon, 10K, 3K fun run, and a marathon relay, catering to 
        runners of all abilities.<br>
        I have run this a few times and my first ever full marathon was in this race. It's very similar to 
        road races in other countries. The course takes you through the charming streets of Reykjavik, with 
        scenic views of the coastline and landmarks like the Hallgrímskirkja church. The event coincides with 
        Reykjavik Culture Night, providing a festive atmosphere with music, performances, and fireworks. <br>

    <h2>Laugavegur Ultra Marathon - July</h2>
    <p>The Laugavegur Ultra Marathon is a 55K trail race that takes runners through one of Iceland's most famous 
        hiking trails. The race begins in Landmannalaugar and ends in Þórsmörk, covering diverse terrains such as 
        geothermal hot springs, river crossings, and volcanic deserts. It's a must-do for trail running enthusiasts 
        seeking an adventure in Iceland's wilderness.<br>
        I have run this race 3 times and I highly recommend it! The surroundings are absolutely breathtaking and 
        the terrain is not as difficult as in many other ultras. Keep in mind though that the weather can be all 
        kinds. It can be nice and calm weather but it can also be windy, rainy, cold and foggy. In such conditions 
        you may not be able to see the amazing view so it can be a disappointment but it's always an adventure. 
        Also, weather can change very frequently in Iceland so it's unlikely that the whole course will be in the 
        same weather.</p>

    I have run the 22 km course twice. It's one of the more challenging races I have participated in because you 
    climb very steep hills (almost crawling up) and equally steep downwards. The landscape is beautiful so if 
    you're up for a challenge, this race could be perfect for you.</p>
